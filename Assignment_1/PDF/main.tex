\section{Question 2: Zipfâ€™s Law}
\textit{Make sure to clearly answer each part, providing explanations, calculations, or code snippets/results as required.}

\subsection{Part (a)}
% --- Begin Answer Q2(a) ---

Zipf's law is an empirical formula that describes the frequency and order of occurrence of words in a language. Specifically, words are sroted by frequency, then the word frequency is inversely proportional to the rank of the words in the sequence.

\subsection{Part (b)}
% --- Begin Answer Q2(b) ---

Zipf's law is considered to be universal among natural languages, some artficial languages(like Esperanto), and programming languages(like C-Program). Besides, some recent research reports that the output of some generative models also follows Zipf's law.

\subsection{Part (c)}
% --- Begin Answer Q2(c) ---

One of the biggest limitations of Zipf's law is that it doesn't have a very sound theoretical foundation. It is an empirical observation rather than a derived law. Although there are some theoretical models that try to explain it, like the principle of least effort, we still cannot say for sure why it holds for so many languages. Besides, Zipf's law is not a strict law; it is more of a tendency. The type, properties, and size of the corpus can all affect the degree to which Zipf's law holds, like in many Asian languages, the rank-frequency distribution shows very different patterns from that of English, which still needs to be explained.
