  abstract = {OpenAI's GPT-4 is a Large Language Model (LLM) that can generate coherent constructed languages, or "conlangs," which we propose be called "genlangs" when generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The genlangs created by ChatGPT for this research (Voxphera, Vivenzia, and Lumivoxa) each have unique features, appear facially coherent, and plausibly "translate" into English. This study investigates whether genlangs created by ChatGPT follow Zipf's law. Zipf's law approximately holds across all natural and artificially constructed human languages. According to Zipf's law, the word frequencies in a text corpus are inversely proportional to their rank in the frequency table. This means that the most frequent word appears about twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on. We hypothesize that Zipf's law will hold for genlangs because (1) genlangs created by ChatGPT fundamentally operate in the same way as human language with respect to the semantic usefulness of certain tokens, and (2) ChatGPT has been trained on a corpora of text that includes many different languages, all of which exhibit Zipf's law to varying degrees. Through statistical linguistics, we aim to understand if LLM-based languages statistically look human. Our findings indicate that genlangs adhere closely to Zipf's law, supporting the hypothesis that genlangs created by ChatGPT exhibit similar statistical properties to natural and artificial human languages. We also conclude that with human assistance, AI is already capable of creating the world's first fully-functional genlang, and we call for its development.},

  abstract = {We present ongoing research in the application of information theory to animal communication systems with the goal of developing additional detectors and estimators for possible extraterrestrial intelligent signals. Regardless of the species, for intelligence (i.e., complex knowledge) to be transmitted certain rules of information theory must still be obeyed. We demonstrate some preliminary results of applying information theory to socially complex marine mammal species (bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales) as well as arboreal squirrel monkeys, because they almost exclusively rely on vocal signals for their communications, producing signals which can be readily characterized by signal analysis. Metrics such as Zipf's Law and higher-order information-entropic structure are emerging as indicators of the communicative complexity characteristic of an ``intelligent message'' content within these animals' signals, perhaps not surprising given these species' social complexity. In addition to human languages, for comparison we also apply these metrics to pulsar signals---perhaps (arguably) the most ``organized'' of stellar systems---as an example of astrophysical systems that would have to be distinguished from an extraterrestrial intelligence message by such information theoretic filters. We also look at a message transmitted from Earth (Arecibo Observatory) that contains a lot of meaning but little information in the mathematical sense we define it here. We conclude that the study of non-human communication systems on our own planet can make a valuable contribution to the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence by providing quantitative general measures of communicative complexity. Studying the complex communication systems of other intelligent species on our own planet may also be one of the best ways to deprovincialize our thinking about extraterrestrial communication systems in general.},

  abstract = {Zipf's law has been found in many human-related fields, including language, where the frequency of a word is persistently found as a power law function of its frequency rank, known as Zipf's law. However, there is much dispute whether it is a universal law or a statistical artifact, and little is known about what mechanisms may have shaped it. To answer these questions, this study conducted a large scale cross language investigation into Zipf's law. The statistical results show that Zipf's laws in 50 languages all share a 3-segment structural pattern, with each segment demonstrating distinctive linguistic properties and the lower segment invariably bending downwards to deviate from theoretical expectation. This finding indicates that this deviation is a fundamental and universal feature of word frequency distributions in natural languages, not the statistical error of low frequency words. A computer simulation based on the dual-process theory yields Zipf's law with the same structural pattern, suggesting that Zipf's law of natural languages are motivated by common cognitive mechanisms. These results show that Zipf's law in languages is motivated by cognitive mechanisms like dual-processing that govern human verbal behaviors.},
