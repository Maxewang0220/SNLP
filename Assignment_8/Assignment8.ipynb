    "1. HMM assumptions:\n",
    "- Markov Assumption: The current state depends only on the previous state. It is assumed that the future state is independent of all past states, given the present state. \n",
    "- Output Independence Assumption: The current observation is only dependent on the current state. The observation at a specific time is independent of all other states and observations, given the current state. \n",
    "2. <img src=\"HMM.png\" alt=\"graph\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "- Hidden States (x): These are the unobservable states of the system. We cannot directly see which state the model is in. The initial state probabilities define the probability of starting in each hidden state.\n",
    "- Observable States (y): These are the outputs or observations that we can see.\n",
    "- Transitions (a): The arrows between hidden states represent the transition probabilities, which define the likelihood of moving from one hidden state to another.\n",
    "- Emissions (b): The arrows from hidden states to observable states represent the emission probabilities, which define the likelihood of observing a particular output given a hidden state.\n",
    "3. HMMs' limitations:\n",
    "- Markov Assumption is too strong: The assumption that the current state only depends on the previous state is often an oversimplification for many real-world scenarios where longer-term dependencies exist.\n",
    "- Independence of Observations: The assumption that observations are independent of each other, given the current state, can be restrictive. In many applications, observations may have dependencies among themselves.\n",
    "- Fixed Number of States: The number of hidden states must be determined before training the model, which can be a difficult and critical decision.\n",
    "- Lack of Contextual Information: HMMs do not inherently model any higher-level contextual or structural information beyond the immediate state-to-state transitions."

    "1. While HMMs are generative models CRFs are discriminativ. Explain why? (0.5 points)\n",
    "2. What are the advantages of CRFs over HMMs? (0.5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "1. HMMs are generative models because they model the joint probability of observations and labels. This means HMMs define how the observations and labels are generated together, and they require modeling the distribution of the inputs. CRFs are discriminative models because they model the conditional probability of the labels given the observations. They focus directly on learning the decision boundary between classes without needing to model how the data is generated. This allows CRFs to incorporate overlapping, non-independent features of the input without making assumptions about their distribution.\n",
    "2. CRFs have several advantages over HMMs:\n",
    "- No strong independence assumptions: CRFs do not assume that observations are conditionally independent given the labels, unlike HMMs.\n",
    "- More flexible feature representation: CRFs allow the use of rich and overlapping features (e.g., context windows) for better modeling.\n",
    "- Better performance in structured prediction: CRFs often outperform HMMs in tasks like part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition, especially with complex input data.\n",
    "- Discriminative training: By directly modeling $P(Y∣X)$, CRFs focus on prediction accuracy rather than data generation, leading to better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Now you will use the `sklearn_crfsuite` to implement a CRF for Part of Speech tagging. You'll be using the Treebank corpus for that. Run the following cell to get the data."
